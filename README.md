# Flask_Final
## Final project for Systems Analysis and Design

This project is meant to mimic a fake hotel's webpage using Flask. It will allow for users to create their own entries for reservations, it will automatically store those reservations in a database, and it will make those database entries visible through a separate webpage. The use of the website should be simple as all of the prompts and links are clearly labled.
